           <h3>Pre-Qualified Appointments That Actually Close</h3>
           <p>Most agencies leave you feeling dissatisfied with unqualified "prospects" and hours of calling for your staff.</p>
           <p>We understand that simply generating "leads" isn't sufficient for growing your practice. What you truly need are financially qualified individuals
            who not only show up, but also genuinely need your help.
           </p>
           <p>That's why we've developed a unique system to meticulously vet every appointment we schedule for your office, completely handled for you and customized to your needs.</p>
